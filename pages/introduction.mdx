<Card href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/json" title="APLICATION/JSON" />

This is the first version of the [4casters.io](https://4casters.io/) streaming API, powered by [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

Find the 4casters rest API [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6710109/U16gNmHG)

To build a client application for this API, we recommend using one of the official Socket.io client libraries.
