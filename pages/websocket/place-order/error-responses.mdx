When the server fails to place an individual order, the **per-order** entry in `data[]` is returned in this shape: 

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
{ 
    "data": [ 
        { 
            "error": "<human-readable message>", 
            "error_type": "<one of: validation_error | rejected_liability |   
            rejected_order_type_rules |   system_error>" 
        },
    ], 
    "requestID":"YOUR_REQUEST_ID" 
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If you receive an error message, the order has not been processed and is safe to submit again.

Errors are returned positionally in the `data` array, matching the index of the input order in your `orders` array. 

- `error` is not standardized; it’s a descriptive string and may vary.
- `error_type` is an enum you can rely on for programmatic handling: 
    - `validation_error` — payload or state failed validation (e.g., missing fields, bad odds/number, invalid side, inactive game).
    - `rejected_liability` — user/account/liability constraints prevented posting or execution. 
    - `rejected_order_type_rules` — order-type rules forbid execution (e.g., fillAndKill found no executable liquidity, so nothing could be filled and the order was rejected, or post order found matches).
    - `system_error` — transient/internal error; retry may succeed.

Here is an example showing multiple order places, some of which incurred an error response.
