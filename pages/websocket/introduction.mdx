This document describes how to use the 4Caster Orders WebSocket API for real-time order placement, cancellation, and 
management. 

## Websocket connection

To connect, establish a WebSocket to this link wss://[orders-api.4casters.io/orders/ws](wss://orders-api.4casters.io/orders/ws)
The WebSocket connection must include an Authorization header containing a valid token from the [4Casters API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6710109/U16gNmHG#1cf564c7-2e87-46a1-8246-b295fe2db3fb).

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://orders-api.4casters.io/orders/ws", {
    headers: {
        Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN,
    } 
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Heartbeat

This message is used to trigger a heartbeat with a given requestTimeout. If another heartbeat message is not received within the requestTimeout period, then all of your orders will be cancelled. 

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
[
    "heartbeat",
    {
        "requestTimeout": NUMBER
    }
]
```
